# Progression-Outliers-Check
Outlier detection for compensation range progression by country and levels. Coded in Python with Jupyter Notebooks.

I have created this to audit the current compensation structure to spot possible errors in compensation range progression to see if anything is too high or too low. For example, a 70% progression for a promotion can be too high in the United States but too low in India. We added this as a systematic audit for our annual market study to improve the quality and consistency of our pay ranges.
